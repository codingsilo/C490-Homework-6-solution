PART I (10 POINTS) Text book, pp96, Exercise 3.10, Body Mass Index Calculator App. Snapshot your testrun (on an AVD or a real device), copy source code (java code and major XML files), and paste them in your submission. PART II (20 POINTS) Text book, pp96, Exercise 3.11, Target-Heart-Rate Calculator App. Snapshot your testrun (on an AVD or a real device), copy source code (java code and major XML files), and paste them in your submission).
PART III (20 POINTS) Create Craps game app. See below the description about the game:
A player rolls two dice. Each dice has six faces. Each face contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 (Lucky Seven) or 11 (Yo-leven) on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum is 2 (Snake Eyes), 3 (Trey) or 12 (Boxcars) on the first throw (called “craps”), the player loses (that is, the “house” wins). If the sum is one of the other values, i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, on the first throw, that sum becomes the player’s “point.”To win, player must continue rolling the dice until they “make their point” (that is, roll their point value). The player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point. In case you are not familiar with this game, an executable PC version Craps game (CrapsGame.exe) is provided in Canvas. You can run the program to get some sense.
Note: The images for the dice are provided in Canvas. You have the freedom to design the GUI in any way you want, as long as it makes sense to the app.
Hints: To programmatically load images to ImageViews, first copy the images onto res/drawable-hdpi folder, then in your code, do the following:

Points: : 50 points Due Date: : July 29th (8:00am) Submissions: : Canvas and hardcopy
die1ImageView.setImageDrawable(getResources().getDrawable(getResource s().getIdentifier(“die1”, “drawable”, getPackageName())));

To enable/disable a button: someButton.setEnabled(true); // or set false to disable.

WHAT TO SUBMIT: – Submit your source code (zip your project folder for each programming project) to Canvas (using the “Assignments” function). Submit a hard copy of your code and test-run output (or screenshot). Make sure that you follow the “Assignment_style-guideline_C490” or you might lose
